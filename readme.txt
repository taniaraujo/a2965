== Description ==
Fitspiration is a modern and versatile theme designed with fitness bloggers in mind. It features a masonry style home page layout with an optional slider and has been designed to support the Instagram Plugin so you can also feature your Insta feed on all pages. We've also included a simple and effective "Classes" page template intended for use by clubs or gyms who want to feature the various classes they offer. Along with this the gallery styling has been done in such a way as to make an ideal Class page (see the demo).
